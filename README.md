## Requirements for Running the Application with Docker

- Docker: To build and run the container.
- Docker Compose: (optional, if you use additional services, such as a database).

### How to run the application with Docker

Here are the steps to run the application in a Docker environment. This will allow you to run the Python Flask server with all the required dependencies inside an isolated container.

### Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

    $ git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/my-portfolio.git
    $ cd my-portfolio

### Build and run Docker

Build the Docker image and run the container. In the project directory, run the following commands:

#### To build the image:

    $ docker build -t my-flask-app .

#### To run the container:

    $ docker run -p 3000:3000 my-flask-app

If you are using Docker Compose, run the command below:

    $ docker-compose up --build

#### Access the Application

The application will be running via a Docker container. To access it in your browser, type the URL:

    $ http://localhost:3000

#### Stop the Application

To stop the application and the container, simply press Ctrl+C in the terminal where Docker is running or, if you are using Docker Compose:

    $ docker-compose down
